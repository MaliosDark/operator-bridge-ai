## 🧩 Overview

This lightweight **PHP bridge** enables **external AI agents** or automation clients to access and manage a Laravel-based system **without modifying core Laravel files**.

The bridge communicates directly with the Laravel database via **secure, modular PHP endpoints**, allowing tasks such as:

- Fetching user data
- Viewing and updating orders
- Approving vendors
- Creating accounts
- Full integration for AI-driven assistants

It is ideal for systems where **Laravel is hosted remotely**, and you want an external brain to control it — without breaking the system during updates.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Upload** this entire folder to your web hosting (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/ai_operator/`)
2. Edit `config.php`:
   - Set your `$ACCESS_KEY` to something strong and secret
   - Add your database credentials (host, name, user, pass)
3. Ensure your Laravel database is accessible from this environment
4. Call the scripts using `GET` requests with your `?key=...`

## 🔧 Example Endpoints

- ✅ **Ping System**
```

```

- 👤 **Get User by Email**
```

[https://yourdomain.com/ai\_operator/get\_user\_by\_email.php?email=test@example.com\&key=your\_secret\_key](https://yourdomain.com/ai_operator/get_user_by_email.php?email=test@example.com&key=your_secret_key)

```

- 📦 **Get Today's Orders**
```

```

- 🏪 **Approve Vendor**
```

[https://yourdomain.com/ai\_operator/approve\_vendor.php?vendor\_id=123\&key=your\_secret\_key](https://yourdomain.com/ai_operator/approve_vendor.php?vendor_id=123&key=your_secret_key)

```

- 🔄 **Set Order Status**
```

[https://yourdomain.com/ai\_operator/set\_order\_status.php?order\_id=10\&status=shipped\&key=your\_secret\_key](https://yourdomain.com/ai_operator/set_order_status.php?order_id=10&status=shipped&key=your_secret_key)

```

- ➕ **Create New User**
```

[https://yourdomain.com/ai\_operator/create\_user.php?name=John\&email=john@example.com\&password=secret123\&key=your\_secret\_key](https://yourdomain.com/ai_operator/create_user.php?name=John&email=john@example.com&password=secret123&key=your_secret_key)

```

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations

- Use **HTTPS** at all times
- Choose a **strong `$ACCESS_KEY`**
- Protect the folder by:
- IP whitelisting
- `.htaccess` rules
- VPN-based isolation
- Place the folder **outside the main Laravel directory** when possible

---

## Cron setup example (on your server crontab):


```
*/5 * * * * php /path/to/ai_operator/health_check.php > /dev/null 2>&1
```
